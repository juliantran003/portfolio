        "description": "ITRSQ was my first employment after graduating from Le Réacteur and where I have acquired most of my experience. Since the company had just been founded and as the only developer there, I had full responsibility for creating websites, database and servers. \r\n As the company grew and we hired more developers, Team Leader was added to my responsibilities. While it certainly wasn't a conventional junior developer experience it was perfect for me since it allowed me to take time in perfecting my base knowledge and exploring new concepts whenever I functionally needed them. \r\n\r\n My everyday responsibilities were as follows : writing frontend code (React, Next.js , HTML, CSS, Netlify + external API's and third-party-packages), backend code (Node.js, Heroku), managing projects, actively working on Github with other developers and customer relations",
